# Relational Operators

Relational operators evaluate the relationship between two variables or expressions.

They determine whether the operand on the left is equal to, different from, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to the operand on the right, returning a boolean value as the result.

Types of relational operators:

- **==** → used to verify if the value of one variable is equal to another
- **!=** → used to verify if one variable is different from another
- **>** → used to verify if one variable is greater than another
- **>=** → used to verify if one variable is greater than or equal to another
- **<** → used to verify if one variable is less than another
- **<=** → used to verify if one variable is less than or equal to another

Example:

```java
int number1 = 1;
int number2 = 2;

if (number1 > number2){
    System.out.println("Number 1 is greater than number 2");
}

if (number1 < number2){
    System.out.println("Number 1 is less than number 2");
}
```
