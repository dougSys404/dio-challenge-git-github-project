# Logical Operators

Logical operators allow the creation of complex logical expressions by combining two or more individual expressions.

Operators:

- **&&** → Logical "AND" operator
- **||** → Logical "OR" operator

Logical operators operate based on the principles of truth tables in Boolean algebra.

The **&&** operator requires that all conditions evaluate to true for the entire expression to be considered true.

The **||** operator requires that at least one of the conditions evaluates to true for the entire expression to be considered true.
